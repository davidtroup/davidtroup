In addition, the lessons have given me the expansive experience of doing something outside of my comfort zone in mid-life. I can’t imagine a better teacher than David Troup for this. He brings knowledge of music theory and Bel Canto technique, a wealth of professional entertaining experience and a wonderful sense of humor and play to his work. I recommend him highly.</p>

                    <p>No other singing teacher has helped me to identify so concretely the difficulties in my singing and to develop techniques that bring about a more confident and uniform sound.  I have gained effective us of my entire range from David’s teaching, and can now tailor my sound to fit the many categories of vocal music that I enjoy.  My lessons have also extended into learning how to create a business and earn income as a singing performer, a subject that is sadly missing from university classes nearly everywhere.</p>

                    <p>David has been incredibly supportive of me throughout the years we have been together, and he has always made sure that I am comfortable.  Along the way, I realized that I had gained much more than a teacher --- I also gained a good friend.  He has made singing and the process of learning enjoyable through his incredible knowledge on the subject, his great sense of humor, and his kindness.</p>
                    <p>One of the other things that has made my learning experience as wonderful as it has been is his vast amount of performing experience.  He is capable of teaching German Art Songs to Italian Opera Arias to Billy Joel and Beatles songs.  David has exposed me to such a diversity of vocal repertoire… repertoire that I never would have thought I would enjoy as much as I do now.</p>
                    <p>I thank David Troup from the bottom of my heart for the life changing experiences I have had with him!</p>

                    <p>It seems like such a long time since we last talked, but time cannot dampen my wonderful memories of singing with you.  Since we said our goodbyes as I headed off to my freshman college year, I am delighted to tell you that I’m now a member of the Harvard Glee Club.  I so love making music with the Glee Club…. oh how I wish you could hear us!</p>
                    <p>David, your lessons gave me my voice, but your warmth and charisma gifted me with the confidence to take the stage.  Thank you for getting my singing journey started.  This winter, I’ll be visiting China with some Glee Club friends, and we will be doing some a cappella singing every opportunity we get.</p>
                    <p>I hope this holiday season brings you the purest warmth and joy --- the kind of “glow” you never fail to pass on to others with your hearty, infectious laughter.  Have a Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year!</p>

                    <p>In my first lesson with David Troup, I began making the sounds that I had only dreamed about.  I floated out of his studio that day as if I was walking on a cloud!</p>
                    <p>David knows how to adapt his voice to many singing styles without compromising its quality.  Through his guidance, I have learned to sing different genres of music ranging from jazz to opera with equal beauty, control, power and excitement.  Moreover, I have gained a great amount of confidence in my solo performing, and I can now sing for an audience of total strangers and love every minute of it!</p>
                    <p>In addition, David is a superb musician who seamlessly blends his knowledge of musicianship into each lesson.  My sight-reading skills and understanding of music theory have improved exponentially under his guidance.  Above all, his greatest gift as a teacher is his positive and encouraging nature with everyone he teaches. </p>
